# DepMap_Analysis

## Overview

This code is used to analyze the Broad Institute’s CRISPR DepMap, and can be used on other CRISPR KO screen datasets. The first project consists of using three statistical tests on gene-level post-Chronos data to discover context-specific essential genes. All data used is from 22Q4, but can be adapted to other datasets depending on changes in annotations.


## Code Files

### DepMap_Analysis.ipynb

Using DepMap 22Q4 post-Chronos data, performs a gene-level statistical analysis among all indications in the “OncotreeLineage” annotation of cell lines.


##  Output Folders/Files

### Results/

Contains compressed CSV (DataFrame) files of the results from each test: Fisher’s Exact, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum, and Independent T-test. Each test was run using the 'OncotreeLineage' annotations from the Broad Institute. Tests were also run using the 'OncotreeSubtype' annotations and can be generated by changing the annotation code in DepMap_Analysis.ipynb.

### sig_genes[#].csv

Contains a list of all context-specific essential genes, as determined by significance and discovered by the DepMap analysis using OncotreeSubtype annotations.
